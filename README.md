I'm a Software Engineer and Co-founder at [**CodicePlastico**](https://codiceplastico.com/), a software house based in Brescia, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, where we focus on crafting quality, tailor-made software solutions.

My passion lies in building robust and maintainable applications through clean code, Agile methodologies, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). I'm particularly interested in exploring different programming paradigms, including functional concepts and the Actor Model (especially with Elixir). I strongly believe in sharing knowledge and actively contribute to the developer community through speaking engagements, writing articles, and conducting workshops.

* **Trainer:** Conduct workshops, including one on the Actor Model with [Avanscoperta](https://www.avanscoperta.it/en/trainers/emanuele-delbono/).
